# HW-21-Book-Search

## Description

This app was built to give the user the ability to search for books using a googlebooks API. The user can browse books without being logged in. If the user signs up and logs in, it opens up the ability to save books to a profile. This application was built using a full MERN stack, utilizing an Apollo Server with GraphQL in place of a RESTful API.
